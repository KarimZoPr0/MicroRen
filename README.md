## What is tiny rasterizer
Tiny Rasterizer is a software renderer, meaning it processes graphics entirely using the CPU rather than relying on specialized GPU hardware. Software rendering has a rich history in computer graphics and remains relevant for its flexibility, educational value, and independence from hardware constraints.

### Why Software Rendering

GPUs offer advanced, high-performance features, but their complexity can overshadow the elegance of basic rendering principles. By stripping away the complexities of GPU programming, the project focuses on the essentials, making it ideal for learning and experimentation

Not every device has a modern GPU or reliable driver support. CPU-based rendering ensures Tiny Rasterizer works on a wider range of systems, from low-end machines to virtualized environments without GPU access. By avoiding GPU-specific optimizations, Tiny Rasterizer can be more easily adapted to different platforms and architectures
